### Note about HTML pages hosted on Github
Github is well-equipped to render markdown (md) documents. If you navigate to an HTML page, what you would see is the HTML code, not its rendering.

To render an HTML page hosted on `github` as your browser would, just use a URL like this:
```
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/OlivierLD/OlivierLD.github.io/blob/master/first.test.html
```
Does not work all the times, but at least some times. You may face some CORS Policy issues...

- <https://pages.github.com/> could be a much better option.
