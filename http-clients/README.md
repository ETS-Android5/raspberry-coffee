# HTTP Clients
We are showing here how to get data from HTTP servers reading breakout boards, 
using drivers we do not need to care about.

Typically, this would concern drivers written in Python, see in the `Papirus` 
(look for `papirus_server.py`) and `I2C-SPI` (look for `lis3mdl_server.py`) modules.


Features: 
- Java
- Scala
- Kotlin
- Groovy
