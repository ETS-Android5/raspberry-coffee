## System resolution
In several languages (for [comparison](./LanguageComparison.md)), along with several samples and linear algebra utilities.

### Java Math REST Server
To be used from a Web UI, there is a Math server for linear algebra operations.

1. Compile what you need
```
 $ ../../gradlew shadowJar
```
2. Start the server
```
 $ ./runMathServer.sh
```
3. From a browser, reach http://localhost:1234/web/smoothing.rest.html

### Note
There is a `Annotated` version of the same server, see in the package `matrix.annotatedserver`.

I find the non-annotated version more flexible (and the code looks nicer), but the annotated
version could probably be generated by tools like Swagger.

In both cases, all operations have the same signature, they take a `Request` as input parameter,
and return a `Response`.

#### TODO 
- See if the Annotated version could be generated by a custom Swagger generator.
- More annotations, like for `@Param`, and see if we can deal with more complex signatures than `Function<Request, Response>`.
