- Show sensors (photo resistor) and relay
- Show and run the code that interacts with the above

#### HTTP, Servers, Clusters, 
- Monoliths
- Client-server
- J(2)EE servers
- Clusters (Docker, K8S)
- . . . 
- SOA
- Micro-services
- FaaS, IoT and friends...

#### Micro-services
- Helidon, what this is
- Helidon, generate skeletons
- Helidon, implement photo-resistor REST interaction (RasPi #1)
- Helidon, implement relay REST interaction (RasPi #2)

#### Interaction
- FaaS
- Expose to an IoT server
    - Expose
    - Show QR Code
    - Switch relay on and off
- Node-RED
    - Build node flow
    - Run it...
