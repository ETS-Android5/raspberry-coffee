# WIP: Plant Watering System
## A real world project, hardware _and_ software

We want to interface a Moisture/Humidity/Temperature sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1298) with
a solenoid valve (https://www.adafruit.com/product/997), to irrigate the plants in need.

TODO: Try a peristaltic pump: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1150

The `STH10` is a temperature and humidity sensor that can be stuck in the soil next to a plant.
The goal here is to read the humidity of the soil, and to water the plan when the humidity goes below a given threshold.

Watering is done by opening a solenoid valve connected to a tank of water.

#### History, Act 1:  Reading the STH10 Sensor. Getting there...
The goal here is to finally heave a Java implementation of the code. See below.

We start from an Arduino sketch, that can read the STH10.
> _Important note_: The 10 K&Omega; resistor is not to be forgotten.

![Arduino wiring](./Arduino.STH10_bb.png)

This produces an output like that:

![Serial console](./serial.console.png)

The idea here is to trigger the valve when the humidity goes below a given threshold.
The valve opens a pipe connected to a tank of water.
As the valve requires a 12 Volt power supply, it will be driven by relay.

On the Raspberry Pi, the code at https://github.com/drohm/pi-sht1x works fine to read the `STH10`, with the following wiring:

![Raspberry Wiring](./RaspberryPI.STH10_bb.png)

Inspired from https://github.com/drohm/pi-sht1x and the [STH1x Specs](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/Sensirion_Humidity_SHT1x_Datasheet_V5.pdf), the Java code is now also available in this project.
It relies on `PI4J`.
See in this project the class named `sensors.sth10.STH10Driver.java`.

> Note on the relay's wiring:
>
> The doc of the relay specifies that it should be fed with a `5V` power supply. This did not work for me on a single relay board.
> (surprisingly, it was working OK on a 2-relay board). The relay goes on when the program is started, does not go down until
> the program terminates with a `gpio.shutdown()`. The reason is that the states `HIGH` and `LOW` is evaluated by
> comparing the power supply with the signal. As the GPIO header of the Raspberry Pi delivers `3.3V`, the comparison with `5V`
> never finds it equal.
>
> Hooking the relay's power supply to `3.3V` fixes the issue, as the comparison with the power supply and the signal find them equals
> when the GPIO pin is `ON`.

### Triggering the valve
https://www.adafruit.com/product/997

With a Relay

##### To determine
- The humidity threshold beyond which to start watering
- How long should the watering last
- How long to wait after watering before re-start measurement

### Extras
- IoT and stuff... We'll see.

### Power supply
12 & 5 Volts.
- 5 for the Raspberry
- 12 for the valve

We will have one 12V power supply (I've used [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/352), [that one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/798) should fit), and use a car cigarette lighter USB adapter to turn it into 5V.
That seems to be the cheapest approach (< $2.00), and it works well.

### The Hardware
The project box, the tank, the hoses...

### Usage

Run the script named `read.probe.sh`. It contains the program's arguments.

If it is run somewhere else than on a Rapsberry PI, data will be _simulated_.

To see the available program arguments:
```
$ java $JAVA_OPTIONS -cp $CP main.STH10 --help

### Simulation
Can prove useful for testing and calibrating.

There is a REST server that helps sending values to the program
- if you are not on a Raspberry Pi
- if you want to enforce simulation (for tests)

Any REST client does the job. Postman, curl, your own code...

See below (the http port depends on you, see program argument `--http-port:` above)

```
$ curl http://localhost:9999/pws/oplist
[
    {
        "verb": "GET",
        "path": "/pws/oplist",
        "description": "List of all available operations.",
        "fn": {}
    },
    {
        "verb": "GET",
        "path": "/pws/sth10-data",
        "description": "Get device Data. Temperature, humidity",
        "fn": {}
    },
    {
        "verb": "GET",
        "path": "/pws/relay-state",
        "description": "Get relay state - ON of OFF.",
        "fn": {}
    },
    {
        "verb": "POST",
        "path": "/pws/sth10-data",
        "description": "Set device Data. Temperature, humidity, for simulation",
        "fn": {}
    },
    {
        "verb": "PUT",
        "path": "/pws/relay-state",
        "description": "Flip the relay - ON of OFF.",
        "fn": {}
    }
]
```

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"temperature":20.17,"humidity":30.23}' http://localhost:9999/pws/sth10-data
```

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:1234/pws/sth10-data

{"temperature":20.17,"humidity":30.23}
```

The REST Server is part of this project, it's a very tiny one that runs fine even on the Raspberry Pi Zero.
Details [here](https://github.com/OlivierLD/raspberry-pi4j-samples/blob/master/common-utils/src/java/http/HTTPServer.java), also
see the method `addRequestManager`.

### External access
Vast topic... An option to consider is HTTP, on top of which the REST server mentioned above relies.

This will be fleshed out. Eventually, we will fully drive the device.

For now, try this (from your phone, tablet, whatever): `http://Rasp.pi.add.ress:2345/web/index.html`

<img src="./docimg/android.jpg" width="450" height="800" alt="Web Interface">

The red dot at the top of the page is an activity witness. It blinks red to green and vice-versa when data are read.

### The real device
First setting:

![In a box](./docimg/setting.01.jpg)

This one is based on a `Raspberry Pi Zero W`. The probe is in the soil. There is no water tank, and the hoses are not connected (yet). This is doing some data logging for now, to
estimate the right values for humidity.

In the `loggers` package, there are several examples of loggers. One is feeding two `feeds` on `Adafruit-IO`.

![Adafruit-IO](./docimg/adafruit-io.png)

### To install
- Flash an SD card with the latest Raspian
- Possibly run
```
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get autoremove
 $ sudo apt-get upgrade
 $ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
- Clone the repo and build the application:
```
 $ git clone https://github.com/OlivierLD/raspberry-pi4j-samples.git
 $ cd raspberry-pi4j-samples/Project.Trunk/PlantWateringSystem
 $ ../../gradlew shadowJar
```
- Copy the `rc.local` into the `/etc` directory (careful with that, hey?)
- Use `raspi-config` to change the machine name (like `pws-rpi`)
- Hook up the probe and relay
- Reboot!
- You should be able to reach the Web UI from another machine on the same network.

Another possibility is to start it remotely from `ssh`:
```
 $ ssh pi@192.168.42.17
 ...
 $ cd raspberry-pi4j-samples/Project.Trunk/PlantWateringSystem
 $ sudo -H -u pi nohup ./read.probe.sh &
 $
```

### Next
- NODE-Red Integration ?
- Integration with the NMEA.Multiplexer ?
- Read the `STH10` as an I<small><sup>2</sup></small>C device ?


### January 2019
When in the air, the `STH10` returns coherent values, but gives unexpected humidity values when in the soil... always close to 100%, if not higher.

I'm trying the [SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13322) (also available from [WaveShare](https://www.waveshare.com/moisture-sensor.htm))... As it is an analog device, it requires an `ADC`, I'll be using an `MCP3008`.

![Spark Fun](./SparkFunSoilMoisture_bb.png)

It does not return the temperature, but it's way less expensive than the `STH10`.

To run the test with the wiring above, run
```
 $ ./sparkfun.cal.sh --miso:23 --mosi:24 --clk:18 --cs:25 --channel:0
 Read an ADC (MCP3008) for 3.3 Volt estimation
 Usage is ./sparkfun.cal.sh --miso:9 --mosi:10 --clk:11 --cs:8 --channel:0
  For miso, mosi, clk & cs, use BCM pin numbers
 Usage is java sensors.sparkfunsoilhumiditysensor.MainMCP3008Sample33 --miso:9 --mosi:10 --clk:11 --cs:8 --channel:0
 Values above are default values (GPIO/BCM numbers).

The value returned above (the `Volume`) goes from 0 to 100%.
It is proportional to the output current, 0 when no current goes through,
100% means 3v3. 

#### The valve
Can be replaced by a [peristaltic pump](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1150), that will not require a tank to be _above_ the valve.
Might be easier to use.

With the MCP3008 and the _SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor_ and a peristaltic pump (12v), it works!

##### Working prototype
- Calibration of the MCP3008 & Soil Moisture Sensor

###### To keep an eye on
- The size of the log file(s). Purge it from time to time if it is on.

##### Next...
With an Adafruit Bonnet.

> _Note_: wires are shown on top of the Bonnet, they are actually _under_ it.

> _Warning_: powering the pump _and_ the Raspberry Pi from the same source can be challenging. The voltage
> drops when the pump starts, and the Raspberry Pi can very well shutdown. This
> is why there is a capacitor in the circuit, acting as a buffer, to avoid a too steep voltage drop when the pump starts.

<small>For the diagram above, I used [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), cool tool.</small>

#### Ideas to move on...
- A Web UI without external libraries
- A gauge in the tank?
