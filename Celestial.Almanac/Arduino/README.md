This was originally an attempt to write the Celestial Computer for the Arduino.

As it is now, it is way too big to fit the memory available on an Arduino.

You c an use the script `mklib.sh` to build a library for Arduino, but the files it contains are too big to be used.

It is OK for C++ though. See the `compile.sh` in the `AstroLib` folder.
