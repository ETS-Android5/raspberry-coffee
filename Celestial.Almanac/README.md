## Celestial Almanac(s)
This is not strictly related to java nor Raspberry Pi.

This is about reproducing the celestial almanac features (available in `common-utils/src/main/java/calc/calculation/nauticalalmanac`)
is several other languages than Java.

We will have
- ES6
- Arduino (ino, C, C++...)
    - > Note: This is too demanding for an Arduino, but it works OK for C & C++. 
- Python
