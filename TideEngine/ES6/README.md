# ES6 Tide Engine, WiP (big time).
This is a tentative, the Java version remains the reference.

**First thing to do, once**:   
Unzip the file `json/json.zip` in the directory it is in. You should end up with a structure like
```
 +- ES6
 | +- json
 | | +- constituents.js
 | | +- stations.js
 | +- tideEngine.js
 |
 . . .
```
This heavily uses the `module` feature of HTML5/ES6. This requires
all this to run on top of a Web Server, HTML pages cannot be used as static resources.

NodeJS, Python, Java can be used...

For Python, use
```
python3 -m http.server [port-number] &
```
Default port number is `8000`.

Then reach <http://localhost:8000/Basic.02.html>, try to look for `Port-Navalo`

To see some basic steps:
- <http://localhost:8000/Basic.01.html>
- <http://localhost:8000/scratch.html>
