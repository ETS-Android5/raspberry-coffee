# ES6 Tide Engine, WiP, big time.
This is a tentative, the Java version remains the reference.

First thing to do, once:   
Unzip the file `json/json.zip` in the directory it is in. You should end up with a structure like
```
 +- ES6
 | +- json
 | | - constituents.js
 | | - stations.js
 | +- tideEngine.js
 . . .
```
