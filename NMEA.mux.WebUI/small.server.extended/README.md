# Case study (WIP) NMEA Multiplexer running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and others
This is a case study, using different hardware configurations to run the same software configuration (the NMEA Multiplexer).

For the hardware details, see [here](../full.server.extended.v2/README.md), as it is the exact same one as in this project.

This example shows how to _**extend**_  the `GenericNMEAMultiplexer`.

It shows how to add features like **TWO** push-buttons, and take ownership of a screen (Nokia, SSD1306...)

It comes with a class named `mux.MultiplexerWithTwoButtons`, that extends the `nmea.mux.GenericNMEAMultiplexer`.
As a result, it's driven by the exact same `properties` file.

To see how to interact with the buttons (to start and stop the logging for example, or
to shutdown the whole server), look for the variables named `pbmOne` and `pbmShift`.

Implements `simple-click`, `double-click`, and `long-click`.

```java
final static PushButtonMaster pbmOne = new PushButtonMaster();
final static PushButtonMaster pbmTwo = new PushButtonMaster();
```

> Note: the code to add here is just there for the buttons management. There is _absolutely no code_
> to add for the `BME280`, the GPS, or the `SSD1306` screen. It is all taken care of by the properties files.

> See `nmea.mux.gps.log.properties` to know how to reference those devices, and 
> `ssd1306.properties` to see how to choose the data to display on the oled screen. 

This is built just like the other examples in this module, just run
```
 $ ./builder.sh
 ```
 and follow the instructions in the console.

### Configurations
All Raspberry Pi models mentioned below can do the job.

#### [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)
RAM: 512 Mb
#### [Raspberry Pi 3 A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/)
RAM: 512 Mb
#### [Raspberry Pi 3 B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
#### [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)
RAM: 1Gb
#### [Raspberry Pi 4 B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
With 4Gb of RAM

Emits its own network. Reachable from other devices (laptops, tablets, smart-phones, smart-watches)
through all available channels (ssh, vnc, tcp, http, etc).
No attached screen required, as ssh and VNC can do the job remotely.
