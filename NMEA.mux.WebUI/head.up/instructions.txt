| To do once, the first time |
+----------------------------+

- Use "switch2tftscreen" to copy the small screen config where it belongs
- Using "raspi-config", choose to boot to the Graphical Desktop
- In "/etc/rc.local", mimic the local file rc.local
- Make sure the file "~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart" is modified to open Chromium on the right page, add the following:

@chromium-browser --incognito --kiosk http://localhost:9999/zip/nmea/headup.html

- Make sure you've disabled the screen sleep as described here:

	- Edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
	- Have a/the line that starts with "xserver-command=" to look like "xserver-command=X -s 0 -dpms"

------------------------

Note:
-----
To close a tab on Chrome: Ctrl-W or Ctrl+F4.
The Web Interface is quite demanding, it might be too much for a small machine.
Server part runs OK though.
