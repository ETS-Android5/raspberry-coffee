# Boat Design
> Work in Progress, a test.

Based on the `Algebra` module, in this project.

## Path #1
- Define Length, Width, Height
- Define a 3D bezier for the rail (on a 2D white board)
<!-- - Define a 2 or 3D bezier for the bow (on a 2D white board) -->
- Define a 2 or 3D bezier for the keel (on a 2D white board)
    - Tweak the way the frames are calculated
- See the result in 3D

Then do the hydrostatic calculations.

### Sep 2021
- Correlated points : the rail and the keel "define" the bow and transom:
  - rail and bow
  - keel and bow
  - rail and transom
  - keel and transom

## To fix
- Transom and bow, when not vertical.
- Close horizontal and vertical cuts.

## TODO's
- Data to WebGL
- Data to Processing (see PitchRoll.pde ...)
