# Boat Design
> Work in Progress, a test.

Based on the `Algebra` module, in this project.

## Path
- Define Length, Width, Height
- Define a 3D bezier for the rail (on a 2D white board)
- Define a 2 or 3D bezier for the bow (on a 2D white board)
- Define a 2 or 3D bezier for the keel (on a 2D white board)
    - Tweak the way the frames are calculated
- See the result in 3D

Then do the hydrostatic calculations.
