/**
 * This is intended to be a Pulse Width Modulation simulation.
 *
 * Not ideal, but is gives an idea.
 *
 * The graphical environment of a laptop (or desktop) has too many things to do for this simulation
 * to be realistic, as opposed to what happens on a Raspberry Pi, where the GPIO pins are
 * the only thing PWM has to deal with.
