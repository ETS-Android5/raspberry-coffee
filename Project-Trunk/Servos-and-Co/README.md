# Servos, Feedback potentiometers
We want to use a Continuous Servo to orient some panel (like a solar panel...),
and a feedback pot to know its actual position.

> _Note_: For this kind of orientation, we could maybe use Standard Servos.
> The thing is that they are quite limited in term of power. 
> We use Continuous Servos to be able to use gear ratios and other worm gear, 
> to de-multiply the load assigned to the servo.
>
> The same could apply to DC and Stepper Motors.   

We can also use some 3D-printed hardware, described in some other repos.
