# REST Tx (transformer)
A platground for an XML/XSD/XSL experiment...

Here is a first scenario:
1. From a Web UI, paste an XML Schema Definition in a text area
1. Submit the document to a REST service
1. The REST service parses the document, and return a subset of its content, in `json` for the user to select the fields he's interested in
1. The corresponding Web Page is displayed, with check-boxes where appropriate
1. The user checks the boxes he needs, and submit the result to a REST service
1. The corresponding XSL Stylesheet is generated, and returned to the user
